These problems have been created by CS50 team from Harvard and posted online for fire along with interesting lectures.
You can find all the materials (lessons, notes and text of the problems solved) online at the following url:
 - https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020 for AI course
 - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023 for generic CS course (introduction to CS) - I solved only few problems, the last ones
 - https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020 for the course focused on the web (even if I followed most of the lessons, i didn't approached any exercise)

The dataset (when used in the projects) have been provided by Cs50, along with part of the code (usually that load the data, when present, or manage the GUI)
